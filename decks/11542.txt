-- This was a special event, Felipe "SIX ROUNDS" Fiuza is a player here in our city who moved to the USA a few years ago.
-- We have the pleasure of his visit every year, sometimes every 2 years, and this time I decided to honor our friend with a tournament named after his infamous nickname, SIX ROUNDS.
-- To make the event themed, I offered a 6-turn deal at the final table, which I obviously BROKE!!!
-- Congratulations my friend, for winning in life and winning the tournament!!! I am proud of you!!!

Deck name: O Syd Faz Falta (We miss you Syd)

Fernando Cesar, aka Sydnelson or “Syd” for short, was a pillar of Brazilian VTES - or world VTES I would say. And my friend. I started playing VTES back when it was called Jyhad, but it was only around 2004 that I really learned the game from Syd, on an old online platform that is no longer active. He did teach several others, online and offline. He gave cards away. He initiated the translation of VTES into Portuguese. He had fun playing the game, and he was friendly to all. He used to say that he didn’t like to win tournaments with over 10 players so his deck lists wouldn’t be published. So it’s fitting that, at least, I don’t explain mine and leave it for thought. Você era, de fato, “o bom,” Syd. Fuck Covid.
