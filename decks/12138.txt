Deck Name: Cats & Dogs
Created by: Jorge Delgado
Description:
Based on Danilo's deck with tweaks by Karim, Laurent & myself. The idea is to trim the deck to the maximum possible in order to be optimized.
Terrorist deck with no defense. You have no friends at the table or they are temporary. Do not hesitate to intimidate and threat if needed.
Could benefit from Wider View and Unmasking. I am happy with the rest of the deck and its flow. Going with zero defense has the advantage of having little or no hand jam.
