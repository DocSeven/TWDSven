What's up Guys, this is Archbishop from Rio de Janeiro, bringing you the recap of our municipal championship!

On December 15, 2024, we held our last tournament of the year for Powerbase: Rio de Janeiro. We had 16 players on a rainy Sunday, with rain for most of the day. It was a bit of a unespected for this time of year here, but that’s not what matters. What matters is that there were 11 preliminary rounds (the 16th player joined in round 2) with intense competition. Unfortunately, Stanislava’s victory was unquestionable, and the player Leonardo Freire from Rio de Janeiro took home the title of Carioca champion, once again proving that the Old School is Old's Coll! It was a success, and our partner store once again provided a new space for our events. We will keep moving forward, as soon I will present the January event. Below is the list of the champion deck!
