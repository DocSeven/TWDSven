Deck Name: Death by a 1000 cuts: We have Thing at home
Description: Throw cards at table and see what happens.
Thanks to Bram for the basic idea of the deck, I made it fit my hand after and with testing in online tourney I decided to throw opium den out and add 2nd club illusions which was so crucial in this tourney, drew it early in each game which made the job so much smoother.
